## Indicator Description

The KT XMaster Formula MT5 is a custom indicator designed for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It provides buy and sell signals based on the calculated moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicators.

The indicator uses the following parameters:

- Moving Averages:
  - Period 1: 10
  - Period 2: 20
- RSI Period: 14
- MACD Parameters:
  - Fast EMA: 12
  - Slow EMA: 26
  - Signal SMA: 9

The indicator buffers are used to display buy and sell signals on the chart.

## Indicator Initialization

The initialization function (`OnInit()`) is called when the indicator is attached to a chart. It performs the following tasks:

- Maps indicator buffers
- Sets buffer 0 as the buy signal buffer
- Sets buffer 1 as the sell signal buffer
- Sets the style of the buffers (arrow style)
- Sets the indicator's short name

## Indicator Calculation

The calculation function (`OnCalculate()`) is called for each new bar on the chart. It calculates new bars and iterates through them to generate buy and sell signals based on the specified conditions.

The following steps are performed for each new bar:

1. Calculate moving averages (`ma1` and `ma2`).
2. Calculate RSI (`rsi`).
3. Calculate MACD (`macd_main` and `macd_signal`).
4. Check for buy signal:
   - If `ma1` is greater than `ma2`, `rsi` is greater than 50, and `macd_main` is greater than `macd_signal`, generate a buy signal.
5. Check for sell signal:
   - If `ma1` is less than `ma2`, `rsi` is less than 50, and `macd_main` is less than `macd_signal`, generate a sell signal.
6. If no signal is generated, set both buy and sell signal buffers to empty.

The calculated buy and sell signals are stored in the indicator buffers (`BuySignalBuffer` and `SellSignalBuffer`), which are then plotted on the chart.
